_Perspective Studies, 8.5"x11", 35mm B&amp;W photos, 2011_

Although developed in 2011 these photos were taken shortly after arriving in NYC almost 10 years ago.  They were my first experiments with 35mm.  I was interested in simultaneously capturing multiple perspectives in one image.  All of these images contain more than one exposure on the same negative.  I tried to maintain a constant relation to a particular object while exposing the film so that there is a constant and static object that stands in relation to transient objects which surround it or inhabit it.  I was mostly interested in experimentation but I found the relation of perspective to motion through space and time to reflect the sort of arbitrary and perhaps illusory way that our self perspective maintains a sense of constancy despite the fact that all other objects in the world are constantly changing and transforming.
