_Dystofuturo, print, 24"x36", spring 2010_

The top section is a rescaled version of "origami photo collage tile".  The bottom was created using a synthesis of digital and hand drawn techniques.  Essentially I was drawing, photographing my drawings, digitally manipulating the photographs, printing these manipulated images and drawing over them.  I would then photograph the new drawings a repeat the process a number of times.
