<p class="pie-img-wrapper">I was working with <a href="http://processing.org">processing</a> to create these colored lines.  They are composed with a degree of randomness in the color selection and transparency.  Each image contains 100,000 lines.  The color of each line is selected in a semi-random way which creates a predominant tone (red for the top, green for the bottom).  Using RGB color (Red, Green, Blue) First the value of the dominant color (red for the top) is determined randomly as a value between zero and one-hundred percent.  That value is then used as the base for the secondary value (blue for the top) and is multiplied again by a random value between zero and one-hundred percent.  The process is repeated for the tertiary color (green for the top).  Essentially what you have is a percentage of red, a percentage of that percentage of blue and a percentage of a percentage of a percentage of green.  This creates a predominant red with a healthy level of tinting from the second and tertiary colors.  The multiple layers of transparent lines create additional depth of color.</p>
<p class="pie-img-wrapper">Essentially, I was attempting to use minimal means to create a surface which is simultaneously highly diversified and highly unified, minimal but complex, rational in composition but also immediate and emotional.</p>
<p class="pie-img-wrapper">It's very simple in output and one of the advantages of this is as a decorative element for digital design.  I originally output only a single pixel of height by a full width (500 pixels).  As a tiled element (i.e. as a webpage background) it takes very little memory but creates a rich and full pin striping that extends naturally over the entire surface.  The actual image file would be approximately equivalent to a mere 23X23 pixel image (tiny).</p>
