The following is written as an introduction to the processing programing language.

My somewhat imprecise and incomplete definition of is the following:  <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> is an open source, object oriented programing language primarily designed for visual output.  If the previous made little to no sense to you, fear not!  Learning programing is an incremental process.  You lear things bit by bit (no pun intended).  A lot of programing methodology is about taking something big and complex and breaking it down into simple and small steps.  Once you work through all the steps, translate them into your new programing <em>language</em> and chain them all together you have a program.  So lets begin our process of thinking like a programmer by breaking the first sentence down and analyzing it.

So first, we have that Processing is <em>open source.</em> Open source programing are programs which are freely shared.  The collaborative aspect of open source software is uniquely beneficial for programmers.  One acronym you will often hear associated with good programing practice is " DRY", which stands for "do not repeat yourself".  With open source and sharable programs and code, the principal of "DRY" can be applied more widely.  For instance, if Jack needs to write a program which finds a random number between one and ten, if Jill has already developed such a function, it will obviously save Jack a lot of time if he can use what Jill has already written and simply "paste" it into his program.  Perhaps Jack will then use that program to create a more complex function, something which can be used to gage the probability of a leaf falling if the temperature reaches a certain temperature.  Jack can then go on to share his new program (which includes Jills) with the world so others can develop there own programs which they can in turn share.  This is one of the most exciting aspects of the open source movement.  The process allows for synergism and rapid growth and development.  Basically, it gives individuals and creators a lot of freedom to make some really cool things (some of which we'll see shortly).

As a side note, the open source movement obviously has a wider applicability than to just programing.  Videos, music, photos and other media are all widely shared to create new art.  If you're interested in sharing and using media in this way, you may be interested in checking out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">creative commons</a> webpage which centralizes much of this publicly shared media.

The second part of our definition of Processing is that it is an "object oriented" programing language.  A thorough definition of object oriented programing (OOP) is beyond the scope of this introduction but the general concept and philosophy can be explained briefly.  OOP is related to the open source philosophy.  OOP allows programmers to create seperated modular programming "objects" which are easily shared and integrated with other programs.  The benefit of OOP can be explained through analogy.  Imagine the keyboard on your desktop PC broke and you ordered a new one online.  Imagine if upon opening the package, a tangled ball of wires, chips, and keys fell out.  Obviously, this would not be very useful.  What we rightly expect to find when we open the package is a fully assembled keyboard which we simply plug into our computer.  Objects in programs are somewhat similar, they allow programmers to share their programs and reuse functions which they've developed for other programs.  Often, these functions are centered around performing a certain set of tasks, like capturing and manipulating video images.  In Processing and many other languages, programmers can collect these together and create libraries which other programmers can access to develop their own programs.

But enough talk about theory, lets check out a couple things on the processing website then take a look at some of the very interesting things people are using processing to do.

First, lets check out some of the libraries: <a href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/">http://processing.org/reference/libraries/</a>

The libraries include extensions to the processing language to everything from manipulating video, creating 3-D animations, creating and manipulating audio, images, emulating physics simulations and more.  All these tools are possible because people are willing to participate and share their work.  The philosophy of open-source and the structure of object orientation help to make this collaboration possible.

Lets take a look at what some people have used these tools to create.  Through this exploration we will see some of the qualities which make Processing such a unique and powerful medium.

First lets take a look at what <a href="http://ONECM.COM">Ryan Alexader</a> has done with the traditional oortrait:

<a href="http://onecm.com/projects/mycelium/">http://onecm.com/projects/mycelium/</a>

<a href="http://vimeo.com/9636677">http://vimeo.com/9636677</a>

In this sketch, we see one thing which makes Processing art so unique.  This is its synthetic nature.  That is it has a tendency to combine different things.  In Ryan's particular sketch he is synthesizing art and science.  Not only in using a logic and language based medium to "draw" a portrait but by using an algorithm based on the growth pattern of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha">hypha</a> fungus.  The fungus grows by "eating" the light areas of the image.  This cross-disciplinary and multimedia approach is common with artists using processing.

For another example, lets take a look at some work by artists <a href="http://everyware.kr/">Hyunwoo Bang and Yunsil Heo</a>.

First lets look at their piece OASIS TWO:  <a href="http://everyware.kr/portfolio/contents/09_oasis/">http://everyware.kr/portfolio/contents/09_oasis/</a>

The artists describe the work as follows:
<blockquote>A surface covered with black sand turns into a pool full of life when people grab and remove a handful of sand away. In this micro-world, virtual creatures are born, live and perish.They recognize their spatial boundaries and obstacles of living and respond to peoples' touch in various ways.
A real-time computer vision engine has been developed to interpret the physical status of diverse materials of the installation. The program populates creatures with various characteristics and controls their behaviors in real-time. A swarm intelligence has been implemented to simulate the flocking behaviors of the creatures and their life-like motions.
The Oasis is not a device invented for people to 'use'. It's a playful space where people feel nature, find life forms, interact with and create virtual worlds. It elicits peoples' basic instincts to touch natural materials.</blockquote>
In the same way that artists traditionally sketched things like landscapes and figures, programing based art is allowing artists to "sketch" behavior.  The synthesis of art and science create unique and interesting work.  But these fields may not in fact be so seemingly unrelated.  In the sense that both art and science are attempting to understand and describe the world, they can be seen as simmilar processes.

OASIS TWO shows some other features common to programing based art.  The first is the tendency to synthesize not only art and science but also various artistic form and genres.  OASIS TWO can be seen as static and sculptural when covered, as a light and video 2D display, and as a dynamic and interactive sculpture.  The interactivity is the second feature common to programing based art.  It helps to create work which is dynamic and in some sense "aware" of the subject.  It allows the viewer to "play" and become involved in the creative process rather than to merely exist as a passive observer of the work.

Lets take a look at another piece by Hyunwoo and Yunsil.  This piece is entitled Candelight:

<a href="http://vimeo.com/9909544">http://vimeo.com/9909544</a>

The artists describe their work as follows:
<blockquote>The title of the piece CANDELIGHT is a compound word of candle and delight. On top of an ultra-slim LED panel, people can grab and move candles around. Candles become fountains of light and generate fluid dynamic field of pixels. The flow field is generated and simulated in real time based on real world physics equations. Shards of light rhythmically burst out from the very bottom of the candles and swim along the flow field like living organisms. On top of the piece a wireless infrared camera is installed and tracks globs of infrared light which are, in our case, the candles. The piece's ambient sound effects in harmony with the visual rendering, different types of lights varying from physical candlelight to the LED screen, and the heat from the candle light itself give people polysensory experiences inspiring them to explore the permeable membrane of the digital interface.</blockquote>
Lets take a look at a cool audio visual project for collaborative music making:

<a href="http://vimeo.com/4820170">http://vimeo.com/4820170</a>

This program created by Memo Akten, Owen Vallis, Jordan Hochenbaum uses a touch screen and beautiful GUI to facilitate the production of music.  In this case the GUI itself could be considered a work of art.

Finally, lets take a look at the interesting interactive work of <a href="http://camilleutterback.com/">Camille Utterback</a>.

<a href="http://camilleutterback.com/projects/liquid-time-series/">http://camilleutterback.com/projects/liquid-time-series/</a>

With the exception of Camille Utterback's Liquid Time piece, all these works and many others can be seen at the <a href="http://processing.org/exhibition/curated_page_10.html">processing exhibition page</a>.  The works highlighted above are really only a small handful.  Artists have taken Processing and programing art in many different directions.  In fact, this flexibility and fluidity is one of the advantages of using programing as a medium.  Programing is almost infinitely flexible and fluid.  Nearly anything which is logically and technically possible can be accomplished.  The ability of artists to work directly with code frees them from the constraints involved when using pre-packaged software.

Although these works are artisically and technically awe inspiring, such works are within the range of abillity for anyone who is interested and dedicated to learning.  As stated earlier, programing is an incremental learning process and through persistent and sustained work, it is possible to gain fluency in the language of programing.

Getting started is simple.  In fact, you don't even need to download software.  simply go to Processings online sketch environment, and you can start writing code immediately:

<a href="http://sketch.processing.org/">http://sketch.processing.org/</a>

Of course, if you become serious about learning Processing you'll want to download a free copy from the processing website:

<a href="http://processing.org/download/">http://processing.org/download/</a>

Processing comes with its own simple IDE (itegreated development environment) which looks similar to the online version and is similarly simple to use.  Processing was developed not just for artists and designers but as a teaching tool for people new to programing.  It's relatively simple and intuitive to use.  The following link explains the basics of the Processing IDE.

<a href="http://processing.org/reference/environment/">http://processing.org/reference/environment/</a>

Lets return to the online processing sketch page.  We see that there is already a program written in the window.  Lets try to run it by pressing the play button in the upper right corner of the screen.

This program is not too exciting, it's the most basic program usually called a "hello world" program.  Lets start looking at the code, poking around and seeing what happens.  Experimentation is a good way to learn programing.

First, look at the first line, it says "//comments here".  The double forward slash markers tell Processing to ignore whatever is written after them.  Making a lot of comments when you're programing is important not only as a reminder to yourself what certain functions are once the program becomes complex but also as a way to communicate with other programmers who may be using and trying to understand your code in the future.

Next we have the word "void setup()".  Simply ignoring "void" for the moment, it seems obvious what setup means.  One would assume that this section is to set things up for our program.  And this is exactly what the setup function does.  Look at the code, see if you can guess what any of the functions do.  Change them, mess with the code and see what happens.  Just refresh your browser if things stop working.

I'm going to try to mess with the background function and see what happens.  Now it's set at "0".  What happens if I change it to "255".  Try and see!

Well, it looks like the background became completely white, we can no longer see the text.  This is because the grayscales value for the background is a value between 0 and 255 with 0 being black and 255 being white.  The reason for the seemingly arbitrary number of 255 has to do with the amount of memory (8-bit) which the program allots for color values.  It so happens that there are exactly 256 values grayscale values which can be stored in 8-bits of memory.  See we're already learning!

But what about all these other functions?  What if we want to learn what they mean?  Remember the importance of commenting on your code?  Well, the program "Processing" it itself code and the creators of processing, being conscientious developers, did a very good job commenting on and documening their code.  If we want to find out what a certain function is or learn about new ones which we can use in our code, we can go to the Processing reference page and look them up:

<a href="http://processing.org/reference/">http://processing.org/reference/</a>

<code> </code>

<code>void setup() { //setup for the program
size(500,500);  //sets the size of the display window
background(0);  //sets the background color
noFill();  //specifies that shapes we make are not to be filled with any color
smooth();  //makes the edges of shapes smooth
stroke(255,20); //specifieds the color of the line, the second value specifies the transparency
}</code>

<code> </code>

<code>void draw(){  //this is a loop, the program repeatedly does whatever is in this block of code
ellipse(random(width),random(height), random(40), random(40);//draws ellipse at a random x and y pt w/a random width between 0 and 40
}</code>
