Sailing Together Around the World takes its name from the title of the book "Sailing Alone Around the World" by the first solo sailing circumnavigator "Joshua Slocum".  The project is meant to be a fun and interactive project that allows people to bridge the digital to the actual world a bit.  The project has its own website and blog.  Please follow it here:

Sailing Around the World is a project in which I take 24 art pieces (simple drawings of ships) and try to get people to pass them one to the next (without mailing) all the way around the world.  It's perhaps overly optimistic to assume that anyone will actually do this but I'm curious none the less.  I've written instructions on the back of each card specifying that the cards are not to be mailed, and are to be given to someone to the west of the person carrying the card.  The person who is in possession of the card is considered "The Captain" and is requested to keep a log of some sort about the ships journey.  The log can contain essentially any digital media.  The log will be emailed to me with the name of the ship and I will compile an online log detailing the ships journey from its home port (NY Harbor) to its eventual return.

The idea for the Sailing Around the World project stems from several interests of mine and trying to tie them all together.  More than anything though, really, I just want to create something that is fun, and interactive.  Something which will be unpredictable

Biographically, sailing has been for quite some time a fascination of mine.  I spent a year and a half living on a small sailbout in the shadows of NYC.  The notion of what is over the next horizon, of who or what I might meet has always been a perennial fascination.  Essentially this project attempt to recreate some of that sense of adventure and discovery.

The idea of traveling and writing I feel are closely intertwined.  Narration it seems is primarily a journey through time and space.  Story telling is such an inherent part of being human.  I'm quite fascinated by this and why we have such a need for story, travel and experience.

Sailing in particular as a mode of travel has always been particularly appealing.  As something of a proud bumpkin living in the city, the felt presence of nature is something which I crave.  I believe that nature and story have certain interrelations.  The information and stories we get living in a modern industrialized place are highly fragmented.  This is not to say they are necessarily bad but they are many, discrete, unpredictable and coming from so many different directions.  Nature on the other hand provides us with an infinite amount of information but this information does not create the anxiety we feel when confronting the data storm of everyday life.  There is so much happening and so much changing in nature but above it all is a sense of harmony, pattern and great beauty.  Sailing for me and sailing stories are to a great extent about the experience of reading nature, of assimilating and observing the world around us.

I'm also interested in sharing art and collaborating.  Thinking of projects that exist outside the gallery and involve the audience as creators.  More than anything, I'm just curious about what will happen, who's out there, who will read this and what they have to say.
