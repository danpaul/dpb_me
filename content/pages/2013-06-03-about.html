Currently living in NYC, I grew up in Idaho. I began programming in my early teens using BASIC and an IBM PCjr. My interest shifted toward philosophy, art and music in my late teens when I began to play piano and paint. After moving to NYC, I became a used book dealer. I continued to work on art in various forms. I studied at the CUNY BA program and graduated with a degree in Programming for the Visual Arts.
