I've established a goal to of start creating art on a more regular basis and am using this as a place to keep notes on my progress and to check in with myself regularly on how things are going. My plan is to create one finished piece per week.

I have two pieces that I'm planning to develop at the moment. The first is partially a programming project called "Sand":https://github.com/danpaul/sand. I've developed this as a way to programattically interact with sound. There are some great tools out there for working with sound including "CSOUND":http://www.csounds.com/, "Max":http://cycling74.com/products/max/, "SuperCollider":http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/ and probably a lot of others that I don't konw about. I decided to make my own tool for a couple of reasons. First, most tools either had a too steap learning curve or were missing the low level manipulation that I was looking for. The tool that I created allows you to deal with sound on a very low level without having to work a lot with configuration details and lets you work with sound using the Ruby programming language, which I like.. a lot. I'm still developing this tool but I feel it is now at a stage of development where I can start creating some things.

My goal is to create a sound collection using this tool. Ultimately, I want to develop the tool to create three dimenional sound compositions using multiple channels and speaker placement (a sort of surround sound concept) but for now, I want to conentrate on developing experiments and trying to develop sounds that I would't be able to create without this tool.

My second goal is to pick up my work on the acrylic drip and tape series I was last working on.
